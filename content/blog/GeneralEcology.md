## Welcome to Human Ecology, Environmental Science, Environmental Sociology!

These three courses are part of a series of elective courses students can take to fulfill requirements for a minor in Environmental Science and Public Health. I designed these courses to be independent of each other, but they can be taken in sequence as students will build on themes and concepts.

Human Ecology (BIOL 130) an introductory-level course aimed to challenge students to develop their sense of inquiry, sense of place, and contemplate their relationship with the animate and inanimate components of our environment, both locally and globally.

Topics in Environmental Science (BIOL 205) is an intermediate level course that introduces students to diverse topics in environmental science - from the arguments in favor of hydrofracking, to re-wilding of Pleistocene fauna, to human population issues, this course provides students with the tools to develop cogent arguments and develop compelling positions on controversial issues.

Environmental Sociology (BIOL 310) is an upper-level course that challenges students to view issues in human societies through the lens of environmental challenges. This course, at first offering, utilized A Sand County Almanac by Aldo Leopold and Toxic Communities by Dorceta Taylor, as the primary readings.
