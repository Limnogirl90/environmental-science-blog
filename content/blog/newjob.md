After graduating in 2021 with my PhD in Biological Sciences from the University of Notre Dame, I decided that I needed to carry out environmental science work that meant something to someone. I needed to expand my realm of experience beyond the walls of a university, so I took a chance at finding work in South Bend. While most newly branded PhDs from Notre Dame tend to fly the nest, I wanted to stay. I was not sure what I wanted, but I felt a tug at my shoulders that directed me to the river that gave South Bend its name.
