## How's the water?

Since 2021, the St. Joseph River Basin of Lake Michigan has been a focal point in my early ecologist career. As the aquatic ecologist for the St. Joseph River Basin Commission, much of my energy is routed into projects designed to characterize the health of the waterways of the basin. These projects take the form of water quality monitoring in which the great outdoors become my office as well as desktop work that involves hours of searching, compiling, and interpreting data that have been collected by other agencies within the basin.
