For many of us today, we are lucky to be surrounded by rivers, lakes, and streams that are healthy enough for us to fish and swim in, or maybe just enjoy watching wildlife. Not to mention, many waterways are a source of drinking water for communities. It may be hard to imagine a time when industries could dump effluent directly into rivers and streams, with no limits on how much. But this was the norm for our waterways. That is, before the 1972 federal Clean Water Act (CWA).

The Clean Water Act of 1972 gave EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) authority to regulate point sources of pollution entering waterways. Thanks to the CWA, the EPA has implemented pollution control programs and wastewater standards for industries. EPA has also developed national water quality criteria recommendations for pollutants in surface waters. The CWA made it unlawful for industries to discharge any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters, unless they obtained a permit. This put an end to decades of industrial effluent pouring into our rivers and streams: the era of abusing our lakes and rivers to the point that they were deemed “dead” or caught on fire came to an end.

At the time of this writing, the CWA celebrates its 50th anniversary, and at this half-century mark, the current status and future of our waterways is present in the minds of many scientists, lawmakers, agricultural producers, and the public. There is much to celebrate and so much work that is yet to be done to continue striving toward the CWA’s goal: for all waters of the US to be “fishable, swimmable, and drinkable”, collectively referred to as designated or “desired” uses. 

Earlier this year, EPA published a summary of the current state of rivers and streams in all 50 states, except Ohio, because it monitors its waterways differently than other states. This report highlighted Indiana as the state that surpassed all other states with the most river miles - nearly 25,000 -  classified as impaired for water contact recreation because they are too polluted for humans to safely recreate in. 

An Indy Star article picked up on this EPA report and abashed the Hoosier state with the following headline:

“New report finds Indiana has the most dirty waterways in U.S. Agriculture is main culprit.”

This searing headline paints a nasty portrait of the Hoosier State: agriculture, the bad guy, polluting our waters! What is to be done? Just imagine, cows tromping in rivers and streams, fertilizer coming off row crop fields in massive sheets into surrounding waters, banks crumbling into the water, E. coli levels numbering in the millions!

But wait a second: If the CWA enacted strict regulations on industries not to discharge pollutants into our waterways, why is agriculture suddenly the bad actor here, and how is it that Indiana is featured as the poster child for this problem, front and center under such scrutinizing lenses? 

It is important to understand what the CWA mandated and what is achievable. A key limitation of the CWA is that it allows the EPA to regulate point sources of pollution - discrete sources such as pipes or manmade ditches. 

What is missing from the CWA is the regulation of nonpoint source pollution, or runoff from different areas of land. Imagine a rain event: if you are in a city, the rain hitting the ground picks up pollutants such as pesticides, sediments, and road salts from urban lawns, sidewalks, buildings, parking lots, and these eventually end up in waterways. The same phenomenon also happens when it rains on agricultural lands - fertilizers, sediments, soils, and E. coli, can end up in our rivers.

Nonpoint source pollution is known as the “wicked problem” (Bellamy et al. XXXX) plaguing waterways around the world. Thinking about how chemicals and other substances from the land can end up in our waterways gives us the bigger picture framework in which it is necessary to work: the watershed. The watershed is an area of land that drains to a body of water, and each of us lives in a watershed. What this means is that our activities on the land - in your backyard, on a farm, on a range, on a sidewalk - all have some impact on what happens downstream in the water.

While there is no federal regulation that can control nonpoint source pollution, the EPA places the onus on the states to monitor their waterways and for local agencies such as Soil and Water Conservation Districts to incentivize land owners and companies to reduce their impact on the water. Not all states are created equally when it comes to monitoring their waterways.

The Indy Star article singled out Indiana as the state with the most polluted, dirtiest waters, but it failed to mention that Indiana has assessed 68% of its total river miles - an impressive feat, given other states with comparable river miles, take Georgia for example, assess far fewer of their river miles. In terms of water monitoring effort, Indiana ranks in the top 15 states that assess the most river miles.

A consequence of having more river miles assessed is that the likelihood of detecting problems increases. If states monitor fewer river miles, their chances of identifying one as impaired for any desired use is also small - in other words, if you don’t go looking for it, you won’t find it!
