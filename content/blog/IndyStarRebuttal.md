For many of us today, we are lucky to be surrounded by rivers, lakes, and streams that are healthy enough for us to fish and swim in, or maybe just enjoy watching wildlife. Not to mention, many waterways are a source of drinking water for communities. It may be hard to imagine a time when industries could dump effluent directly into rivers and streams, with no limits on how much. But this was the norm for our waterways. That is, before the 1972 federal Clean Water Act (CWA).

The Clean Water Act of 1972 gave EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) authority to regulate point sources of pollution entering waterways. Thanks to the CWA, the EPA has implemented pollution control programs and wastewater standards for industries. EPA has also developed national water quality criteria recommendations for pollutants in surface waters. The CWA made it unlawful for industries to discharge any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters, unless they obtained a permit. This put an end to decades of industrial effluent pouring into our rivers and streams: the era of abusing our lakes and rivers to the point that they were deemed “dead” or caught on fire came to an end.

At the time of this writing, the CWA celebrates its 50th anniversary, and at this half-century mark, the current status and future of our waterways is present in the minds of many scientists, lawmakers, agricultural producers, and the public. There is much to celebrate and so much work that is yet to be done to continue striving toward the CWA’s goal: for all waters of the US to be “fishable, swimmable, and drinkable”, collectively referred to as designated or “desired” uses. 

Earlier this year, EPA published a summary of the current state of rivers and streams in all 50 states, except Ohio, because it monitors its waterways differently than other states. This report highlighted Indiana as the state that surpassed all other states with the most river miles - nearly 25,000 -  classified as impaired for water contact recreation because they are too polluted for humans to safely recreate in. 

An Indy Star article picked up on this EPA report and abashed the Hoosier state with the following headline:

“New report finds Indiana has the most dirty waterways in U.S. Agriculture is main culprit.”

This searing headline paints a nasty portrait of the Hoosier State: agriculture, the bad guy, polluting our waters! What is to be done? Just imagine, cows tromping in rivers and streams, fertilizer coming off row crop fields in massive sheets into surrounding waters, banks crumbling into the water, E. coli levels numbering in the millions!

But wait a second: If the CWA enacted strict regulations on industries not to discharge pollutants into our waterways, why is agriculture suddenly the bad actor here, and how is it that Indiana is featured as the poster child for this problem, front and center under such scrutinizing lenses? 

It is important to understand what the CWA mandated and what is achievable. A key limitation of the CWA is that it allows the EPA to regulate point sources of pollution - discrete sources such as pipes or manmade ditches. 

What is missing from the CWA is the regulation of nonpoint source pollution, or runoff from different areas of land. Imagine a rain event: if you are in a city, the rain hitting the ground picks up pollutants such as pesticides, sediments, and road salts from urban lawns, sidewalks, buildings, parking lots, and these eventually end up in waterways. The same phenomenon also happens when it rains on agricultural lands - fertilizers, sediments, soils, and E. coli, can end up in our rivers.

Nonpoint source pollution is known as the “wicked problem” (Bellamy et al. XXXX) plaguing waterways around the world. Thinking about how chemicals and other substances from the land can end up in our waterways gives us the bigger picture framework in which it is necessary to work: the watershed. The watershed is an area of land that drains to a body of water, and each of us lives in a watershed. What this means is that our activities on the land - in your backyard, on a farm, on a range, on a sidewalk - all have some impact on what happens downstream in the water.

While there is no federal regulation that can control nonpoint source pollution, the EPA places the onus on the states to monitor their waterways and for local agencies such as Soil and Water Conservation Districts to incentivize land owners and companies to reduce their impact on the water. Not all states are created equally when it comes to monitoring their waterways.

The Indy Star article singled out Indiana as the state with the most polluted, dirtiest waters, but it failed to mention that Indiana has assessed 68% of its total river miles - an impressive feat, given other states with comparable river miles, take Georgia for example, assess far fewer of their river miles. In terms of water monitoring effort, Indiana ranks in the top 15 states that assess the most river miles.

A consequence of having more river miles assessed is that the likelihood of detecting problems increases. If states monitor fewer river miles, their chances of identifying one as impaired for any desired use is also small - in other words, if you don’t go looking for it, you won’t find it!

The graph above is a scatterplot showing a point for all 50 states (except Ohio) that represents the number of impaired river miles on the horizontal axis and river miles assessed on the vertical axis. The red point is Indiana. 

As you can see by this graphic, Indiana does not top the charts in the total number of river miles impaired for any use, but it does rank high in the total number of river miles assessed for any designated use.

Indeed, Indiana has a rigorous water monitoring program throughout the state, and through the Hoosier Riverwatch Program, volunteer evaluators can monitor any stream and submit data to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. Furthermore, Indiana is unique in that it is one of only a handful of states that has river basin commissions, entities that exist to provide a forum for the discussion, study, and evaluation of water resource issues. Indiana has four river basin commissions: the Kankakee and Yellow River Basin Watershed Development Commission, Maumee, Upper Wabash, and St. Joseph River Basin Commission. 

If we focus on just the St. Joseph River Basin, which encompasses nearly 5,000 square miles shared between northern Indiana and southern Michigan that drains to Lake Michigan, we can see a strong, cross-organizational effort to monitor water quality. The St. Joseph River Basin Commission (SJRBC) was formed in the late 1980s by the General Assembly to study E. coli in the St. Joseph River in response to public health concerns over high E. coli levels in the river. This also happened to be during a time when there was a lot of positive energy surrounding white water kayaking on the river, as South Bend is famous for its East Race Water Course.

Over thirty years later, the SJRBC and many other agencies working in the basin have worked hard on characterizing the health of the waterways that drain to Lake Michigan. In just our basin alone, we have extensive data on E. coli, nutrients, fish, macroinvertebrates, flow, land use changes - all of which are needed to assess overall water quality and watershed health. Like the rest of Indiana, we are surrounded by a significant area of agricultural land, but we also have urban and industrial areas that also contribute to water quality issues.

A watershed framework tells us that we are all part of the problem of nonpoint source pollution, not just agriculture. In this watershed philosophy, each of us lives upstream and downstream of something or someone else, which means we need to work together and meet people where they are, and not call out entire groups or sectors for negligence. 

In fact, how can we point the finger at nonpoint source pollution, when it is a diffuse and chronic problem with multiple sources?

Instead, acknowledging that we contribute to this collective issue that stems from decades of intensive land use - hardening of the land, draining wetlands, rushing the water off the fields, off the sidewalks, channelizing rivers and streams, the list goes on - and finding out about the progress, will move us forward. For example, the St. Joseph River in the early 1900s had only 3 species of fish documented, and now, researchers are finding upwards of 80 species. In our basin, efforts to improve water quality start small but add up: pervious pavement, grassed swales, rain gardens, two-stage ditches, cover crops.

There is no doubt, Indiana can do better when it comes to water quality. But we are certainly not the only state that sees room for improvement! And, instead of focusing on the negative aspects of our rivers, it is time to highlight the successes. Calling out our water as dirty may inspire outrage and perhaps a short lived call to action, but it does not engender appreciation and respect for our water resources. Furthermore, the short-sightedness of the article ignored the even greater repercussions of dirty water in Indiana: that our dirty water has to go somewhere. And depending on the stream’s location in the watershed, that water goes to the Great Lakes or the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to ongoing problems such as harmful algae blooms and dead zones.

To conclude, Indiana may have topped the charts in the number of river miles impaired for water contact recreation, but that is because Indiana is following EPA requirements to monitor water. Indiana joins the ranks of other progressive states who are taking the lead on getting a handle on the severity and extent of water resource issues, and without such monitoring, problems may not become visible in the media headlines, but they are very real. 

The first step to solving a problem is acknowledging that the problem exists. The steps that follow are up to each of us, not to point fingers at others when deep down we know we are all part of the problem, and that we each are part of the solution.
